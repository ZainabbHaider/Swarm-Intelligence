 # Swarm Intelligence 

## Overview
This project explores the concept of swarm intelligence through two main components: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for solving the graph coloring problem and a visualization of particle systems using the Processing language. 
## Graph Coloring with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
Ant Colony Optimization is a metaheuristic inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It involves simulating the movement of ants to find optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. In this project, ACO is applied to the graph coloring problem, where the goal is to minimise the number of colors needed to color a graph ssuch that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

## Particle System Visualization in Processing - Gardening Simulator
Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. In this project, Processing is used to visualize particle systems by make a gardening simulator where particle systems are used to model different plant growth factors such as sunlight, water, and fertilizer. The simulator is interactive, allowing users to adjust these factors and observe their effects on plant growth.

Demo of the simulator can be seen here: [Gardening Simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvNitJENMG8)
